=head1 NAME

tc_ - Plugin to monitor traffic control queue class bandwidth usage

=head1 APPLICABLE SYSTEMS

Linux 2.5.40+, 2.6.x, 3.x, 4.x

=head1 CONFIGURATION

None needed.

=head1 INTERPRETATION

Traffic control is the name given to the sets of queuing systems and mechanisms by which packets are received and transmitted on a router. This includes deciding which (and whether) packets to accept at what rate on the input of an interface and determining which packets to transmit in what order at what rate on the output of an interface.

This plugin monitors the bandwidth used by each queue class. The root class will draw as a single line, whereas children will be drawn in a stacked graph. Complex hierarchies which have more than the root and its direct children are not fully supported and may not render correctly.

=head1 SEE ALSO

"man tc" and "tc -s class show dev <interface>" to get more information about tc and to see the format of the statistics being parsed.
